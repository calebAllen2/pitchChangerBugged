Pitch Changer in JavaScript

NOTE: You have to refresh the page everytime you want to
      restart the program. sorry.

Disclaimer
- This program is supposed to record a clip of your
  voice then change the pitch and play it back to 
  you.
- It works completely fine except for one annoying bug
  that I can't figure out: Theres a slight "buzzing" over
  the processed audio clip (if you test the program you will
  see what I mean).
- Im not a signal processing expert infact this is the first
  time I have ever worked with signal processing. So if you are
  here from Stack Exchange your expertise is greatly appriciated!

How to use program
- Open "index" with chrome (I have only tested in chrome so I would
  recommend using it).
- Click record, and click Allow Microphone. if you click deny by 
  accidentjust refresh the page and do it again.
- Specify a pitch change factor between 0.5(one octave down) and 2
  (one octave up) (the value 1 will give the same pitch as the 
  original clip) if you don't specify a value you'll get an 
  error so you have to give a value.
- You can change the clip duration by editing "recordDuration"
  in the file "pitchChanger.js" then click save the program 
  and refresh the webpage

When viewing source code
- Its in JavaScript so it should be pretty easy to understand (I hope)
- Ignore "processor.js", all it does is handle the recording.
- The fourierTransform file has the FFT and IFFT functions that I 
  wrote based on the Cooleyâ€“Tukey radix 2 algorithm. I checked over these
  functions and I don't think they are creating the "buzz" artifact but it 
  wouldn't hurt if someone could look over them.
- The main code is in "pitchChanger.js"
